Hi,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm Nicolas, and I’m excited to share an incredible opportunity with you. At Shopify, we're launching Shop Minis—a platform designed to create next-gen shopping experiences for Shop users.

We’d love to invite strategic technologic partners like you to join us as early development partners.

Please have a look to this short video that will introduce the project in more details

The Opportunity:

Develop cutting-edge Minis for clients or as proprietary products.

Engage in retainer and/or revenue-sharing models.

Achieve preferred partner status with co-marketing opportunities.

Gain access to Shop's APIs and engineering support.

Why This Could Interest You:

Distribution: Your Mini will have instant access to Shop's user base (a top 3 shopping app).

Technical: Built with React, with a typical development time of 2-4 weeks.

Incentive: The maximum total incentive payment is $10k per partner, not per Mini. The payment amount per Mini will be determined based on its quality, completeness, and value at the time of review and approval. Partners may submit multiple Minis; Total payments across all Minis will not exceed $10k. (Beta program ends December 31st).

Long-term: Benefit from an engagement-based revenue share starting mid-2026.

Support: Connect with us via a private Slack channel for draft reviews and hands-on guidance.

We'll add you to our private slack partner channel and provide hands-on support throughout the development, review, and payment process.

What Makes a Great Mini?

Your Mini should ideally have at least one of these attributes:

✅ Cross-Catalog: Works better with access to 500K+ merchants.

✅ Personalized: Utilizes user data like preferences, followed shops, purchase history.

✅ Habit-Forming: Encourages daily engagement (social features, daily content, challenges).

Quick FAQ:

Mobile or web? Mobile-only (iOS & Android). Built with web tech (React), but runs in Shop mobile app.

How long does it take to build? Typically 2-4 weeks.

Approval process? 5-day review turnaround.

Ongoing support? Private Slack channel with our team.
